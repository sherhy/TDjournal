# Journaling
I made this repository in realisation that I am beginning have more ideas
to add to this script, and a version control is necessary.

# Template (for now):
#### Yesterday:
###### What did I learn?
- Desgin Patterns: Reflection

###### What did I read?
- from _Misbehaving_: Narrow viewing

###### What did I do to help my future?
- Set up a savings account

#### Now:
Just remembered that someone told me the other day,
> blablabla
and I realised I didn't want to choose my dream from a menu.

#### Today ({TODAY.strftime("%A")}):
###### Events:
- Appleseed@Shibuya
    - Johnny Bravo, as always. We discussed business ideas over pints.

###### Outcomes, Tasks, Questions:
- Visa approved

- [ ] List-up candidate interns

> Gather tracking data with one BQ table and parse later,
> or make a table for each benchmark from the beginning?

###### Accomplishments:
- Wrote an impressive readme.md
```
